# Explanation of the codes for the weather project


## First, explain the html code
  
This code is an example of a simple HTML file for a "Weather Journal" application.

The first line, <!DOCTYPE html>, is a declaration that specifies the type of document being used as an HTML5 document.

The <html> element is the root element of the HTML page and contains all the content.

The <head> element contains metadata about the document, including the title of the page, which is displayed in the browser tab, and a link to a stylesheet file "style.css" that specifies the look and layout of the page.

The <body> element contains the main content of the page, including a header with a title "Weather Journal" and a form for adding weather entries. The form has three input fields for city, description, and temperature, and a submit button.

There is also a section for displaying the entries, which will be added dynamically using JavaScript code in the "app.js" file

## Second, explain the css code

This code is written in CSS, which stands for Cascading Style Sheets, and is used to define the visual appearance of a webpage.

The code sets various styles for different HTML elements in the page. The "body" element sets the default font family to sans-serif and sets the background color to a light gray color (#f2f2f2). The "header" element sets the background color to dark gray (#333), sets the text color to white, adds some padding, and centers the text.

The "main" element sets the maximum width to 600px, centers it on the page by using margin auto, and adds some padding. The "form" element sets the background color to white, adds some padding, and gives it a subtle box shadow to make it stand out from the background.

The "input" and "button" elements are set to display as block elements and have a width of 100% of their container. They also have some padding, a font size of 16px, and a margin at the bottom for spacing. The box-sizing property is set to border-box, which makes sure that the size of the element includes its padding and borders.

The input elements with a type of "text" or "number" have a 1px solid light gray border (#ccc). The button with a type of "submit" has a dark gray background color, white text color, no border, and the cursor changes to a pointer when hovered over.

The "section#entries" element sets a top margin of 40px. The "h2" element has a top margin of 0. The "ul#entry-list" element sets the list-style to none and removes any padding. The "li.entry" element sets a white background, adds some padding, adds a bottom margin for spacing, and gives it a subtle box shadow.


## Finally explain the javascript code


This code is written in JavaScript and is used to add functionality to a weather form on a webpage.

The code starts by declaring four variables that reference different HTML elements on the page. The "form" variable references the HTML form with an ID of "weather-form". The "cityInput", "descriptionInput", and "temperatureInput" variables reference the input fields for the city name, weather description, and temperature respectively. The "entryList" variable references the unordered list with an ID of "entry-list".

Next, the code adds a submit event listener to the form. When the form is submitted, the event listener is triggered and calls a callback function. The event object's "preventDefault" method is called to prevent the default behavior of the form (i.e. submitting the form and reloading the page).

The function then extracts the values of the city, description, and temperature inputs and stores them in the "city", "description", and "temperature" variables respectively.

Next, a new list item element is created using the "document.createElement" method and is assigned to the "entry" variable. The "classList.add" method is used to add the class "entry" to the list item. The inner HTML of the list item is set to display the city, description, and temperature, with the values being dynamically inserted into the HTML string using template literals.

Finally, the newly created list item is appended to the end of the entry list using the "appendChild" method. The values of the city, description, and temperature inputs are then cleared by setting their values to an empty string.
